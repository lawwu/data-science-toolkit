Ideally a new data science hire would go through these resources in the first 30-60 days. I started this with a junior data scientist in my mind working for a data science team using Python and GCP. This is roughly ordered.

# Computer & Environment Setup

## Productivity

[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/): A window management app for macOS, Rectangle enables you to quickly and effortlessly resize and organize your windows using keyboard shortcuts or by dragging windows to screen edges. Iused to use ShiftIt which did something similar but Rectangle does the same thing but works on the latest versions of macOS.

[Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats): An open-source system monitor for macOS, Stats provides you with detailed information on your CPU, memory, disk, network, and battery usage, all accessible from your menu bar. I used to pay for iStat Menus but stats is an open source version.

[Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12): Keep your Mac awake and prevent it from sleeping with Amphetamine, a powerful and customizable app that allows you to set rules based on applications, time, or power source. Similar to the Caffiene app.

[Be Focused](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973134470?mt=12): A productivity-enhancing time management app, Be Focused utilizes the Pomodoro Technique to help you break work into manageable intervals, maintain focus, and stay on track. I find using Pomodoros, setting 25 minute timers of focused work to be incredibly helpful.

[Hidden Bar](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden): A minimalist app that allows you to declutter your Mac's menu bar by hiding icons you don't need to see all the time, Hidden Bar lets you access these icons with a simple click whenever needed.


## Developer Tools

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): A must-have package manager for macOS, Homebrew makes it easy to install, update, and manage software packages, including command-line tools and graphical applications.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A versatile and free source code editor developed by Microsoft, Visual Studio Code supports a wide range of programming languages and comes with built-in support for Git, intelligent code completion, and a plethora of extensions to customize your coding environment.

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/): A highly customizable and feature-rich terminal emulator for macOS, iTerm2 improves upon the default Terminal app with features like split panes, search functionality, and extensive customization options.

[Anaconda/Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html): Anaconda is a powerful Python and R distribution that simplifies package management and deployment, while Miniconda is its lightweight counterpart. Both options provide you with the essential tools to set up and manage your data science and machine learning environments.

[zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH): zsh has become my bash replacement.

[Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh): Makes zsh more useful with a bunch of plugins.

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): A sophisticated and lightning-fast text editor designed for code, markup, and prose, Sublime Text offers a sleek interface, multiple selections, and a highly extensible plugin API.

# Data

Hadley Wickham's [tidy data paper](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) first introduced me to the idea of tidy data. I first read it around 2017 when I first was getting into data analytics. Totally changed how I thought about representing data and put categories to shapes of data like "wide" and "long" data.

Read the original paper: https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf
Work through some Python examples: https://byuidatascience.github.io/python4ds/tidy-data.html

# SQL

This is one of the most important skills for a data scientist as most of the data lives in databases. Therefore, being able to extract and manipulate data using SQL is crucial. Mode Analytics provides a good tutorial. Start with the intermediate one. https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/

## Jupyter

- Similar to [@radekosmulski](https://twitter.com/radekosmulski/status/1638882676596948997), I use VS Code exclusively in order to use Github Copilot in Jupyter
- You can [remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) to connect to a server and run Jupyter on the server and use Copilot there as well (bare metal VMs, Cloud VMs, etc)
- Learn [hotkeys](https://towardsdatascience.com/jypyter-notebook-shortcuts-bf0101a98330) 

## Streamlit

- Learn by working through the [official example](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/create-an-app)
- [Streamlit Cheatsheet](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/cheatsheet)

# Github Copilot

Use [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for all coding (Python, Jupyter, SQL, etc.). I estimate it makes me 20% more productive for all programming tasks.
